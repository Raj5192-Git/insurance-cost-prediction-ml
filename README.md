# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on individual attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. By applying machine learning regression techniques, the model helps estimate insurance charges and understand the key factors influencing medical expenses.

## Problem Statement
Medical insurance costs vary significantly across individuals due to lifestyle and demographic factors. Manually estimating insurance charges is inefficient and inaccurate. This project builds a data-driven machine learning model to predict insurance costs and identify the most impactful features.

## Dataset
- Source: Medical Insurance Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Key Features:
  - age
  - sex
  - bmi
  - children
  - smoker
  - region
  - charges (target variable)

## Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection  
5. Model training using regression algorithms  
6. Model evaluation using performance metrics  

## Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression  
- (Optional: Add others if used like Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

## Results
The trained model successfully predicts medical insurance charges with reasonable accuracy. Smoking status and age were observed to be the most influential factors affecting insurance costs.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
